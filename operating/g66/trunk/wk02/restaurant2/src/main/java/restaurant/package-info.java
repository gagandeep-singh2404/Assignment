/**
 * Extended initial version.
 * The queue is unit tested and there is a customer that
 * "talks" to the employees to tell what he would like and to whom
 * the meals are served. The customer is a test class in disguise and
 * meticulously counts what he order and what is served. At the end of the visit
 * he tells if he was satisfied with the service.
 * This version does not do any concurrency yet, and is therefor
 * most probably broken, thread safety wise on multiple accounts.
